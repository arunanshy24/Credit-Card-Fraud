## 💡 About the Project

Credit card fraud detection is a critical challenge due to the **highly imbalanced** nature of real-world transaction data—legitimate transactions overwhelmingly outnumber fraudulent ones.
Because of this imbalance, **Precision** becomes a crucial metric: too many False Positives means legitimate customers get blocked.

This project compares six machine learning algorithms using Python and Scikit-learn to determine the most suitable model for deployment.

## 🏆 Key Findings & Best Model

Six models were evaluated using:

* **Accuracy**
* **AUC-ROC Score**
* **Precision Score**

### ⭐ Best Model Recommendation

| Model                                 | Accuracy     | AUC-ROC      | Precision    | Reasoning                                                                    |
